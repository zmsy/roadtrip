 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_restaurant_chains_in_the_United_States
 *
 * This was the code, roughly. I'd saved the above into an HTML file in advance.
 *
 * ```python
 * raw_df_list = pd.read_html("restaurants.html")
 * df_list = [x for x in raw_df_list if 'Headquarters' in x.columns]
 * cat = pd.concat(df_list, ignore_index=True, sort=False)
 * with open("restaurants.json", "w") as out_file:
 *     out_file.write(cat.to_json(orient="records"))
